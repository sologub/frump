## Tasks

### Task 3 - Write docs
Describe in README.md Tasks.md's philosophy, format and usage scenarios.  
_Status: working, assigned to Ruslan_  

Comments:
> Ruslan: Possible we need dedicated docs files, not sure though.  

### Task 4 - Recommend for _Header_ to include info about Frump
File _frump.md_ is not a good place for project's description, as
we already have it in the README.md file.  
Recommend to store in Frump's _Header_ some info about the _frump.md_ file, 
instead of project's description.  
_Status: working_

### Task 5 - Write about tasks IDs
Write how tasks IDs must be formatted, and eventual implications.
